## Presentation
SportSee is a dashboard prototype for tracking a user's workout stats (weight, calorie intake, performance...).  
This is project #12 of my OpenClassrooms front-end development course!

## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS (**version 16.15.0**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM (**version 8.5.5**)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [React (**version 17.0.2**)](https://en.reactjs.org/)

## Installing the app

### Back-end
This repository is the front-end part of Sportsee. The back-end is in this repository: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard.git – you first need to follow their instructions to install it.

### Front-end
Once the back-end is installed:
- Fork and clone this repository
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app
So all links work, you should start the back-end first, so it runs on localhost:3000 and the front-end runs on localhost:3001. To do so:

### Back-end
- Move to the location of the back-end repository on your machine using `cd`
- Run `npm run dev`

### Front-end
Once the back-end is running on port 3000:
- Open a new terminal
- Move to the location of the front-end repository on your machine using `cd`
- Run `npm start`
- You should get a message warning you that something's already running on port 3000, and asking if you want to run this on another port: say yes!
